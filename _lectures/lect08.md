And then write a short paragraph:
  - Put yourself in the shoes of the instructor for the course to which you are assigned.
  - If it were up to you, how would you handle academic integrity now, during the pandemic, if you were the instructor of record for the course you are teaching?
  
# For this week:

* I'll put you in breakout rooms by course

* Python intro level courses: CS8, CS8, Data Science
* C++ intro level courses: CS16, CS24, CS32
* More Advanced Courses: CS64, CS130A, CS130B, CS156

Each breakout room: Choose a scribe, and have that person share their screen.

Then Each person just talk about these questions.  Have the scribe make notes as they talk.
* What's happening in your course?
* What are the most important challenges the students are facing?
* What are the most important challenges the LAs/TAs are facing?
* What are the most important challenges the instructors are facing?

When it's the scribes turn, some one else can take the notes on the slack channel.

Then as a group:
* Are there common themes?   If so, what are they?  Have the scribe make a few notes.

At 1:15 we'll return to the main room and discuss.
