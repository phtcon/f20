Prepare a 3 - 5 minute talk about the research paper you read and summarized in [h02](https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/s20/hwk/h02/). Your talk should summarize the key contributions and main takeaways of the paper. Also comment on what aspects of the work would be interesting to incorporate in our current tutor program. You may use a few slides for your presentation or none at all. Open the floor for questions after your talk.
