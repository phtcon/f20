# Homework H02

* Please read and summarize one research paper about CS Education.
* There is a list of suggested papers [here](/f19/info/papers/).  
   * Or you can find your own using the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org) to look for papers in the list of educational conferences and journals in your domain.  
   * Any paper that is "related work" to the ones in the list is acceptable (i.e. cited by, or cites).
   * If you go further afield than that, please check in with your supervising instructor; send them a link to the paper in the Digital Library.  (The "ACM Ref") is a good way to cite it.
* Please submit your work via gradescope

# Explanation / Observation Activity

* Look through a list of common questions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWwtF-r9RcklYFiB9tkY2j6nJ30fUV8TWMa3rFoWzjk)
* Break up into groups of 4
* Two students will be an "observer"
* One student will be the "tutor"
* One student will be the "student"
* Observers will take notes on how the tutor worked with the student for various topics.
* Each tutor will help answer the student questions in 2, 3, and 5 minute timeboxes.
* After a tutor finishes the explanation, students will switch roles such that everyone will have an opportunity to be a tutor.
   * For each student observed, please submit comments on the google form: [https://forms.gle/F12LTd5YTQ9wwykNA](https://forms.gle/F12LTd5YTQ9wwykNA)
