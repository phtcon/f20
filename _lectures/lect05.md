# Explanation / Observation Activity

* Here are some [code examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1C-b4joigU7IEfnNg1up6iYOfZcN80PX_Tj1Ta7gnQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* Here are some [common questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWwtF-r9RcklYFiB9tkY2j6nJ30fUV8TWMa3rFoWzjk)


We'll use Zoom breakout rooms with around 4 students:

* Break up into groups of 4

* One student will be the "student".  The student should choose a question or problem from the links above, and pose it to the tutor.
* One student will be the "tutor".  The tutor will do their best to help the student.
* Remaining students will be "observers", one of which is also the "timekeeper"


Observers will take notes on how the tutor worked with the student for
various topics.  You may do this in a Google Document, Word Document or in any format that you can submit to Gauchospace.

* Each tutor will help answer the student questions in 2, 3, or 5 minute timeboxes
  (Timekeeper would keep track of the time taken.)
  
* After a tutor finishes the explanation, students will switch roles such that everyone will have an opportunity to be a tutor.
   

After each student has had a chance to take a turn tutoring, and/or at 1:20pm (with 25 minutes left in class), return to the main Zoom room for a whole group discussion.
