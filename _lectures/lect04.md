This week, the icebreaker ran long because we had really good discussions from our tutoring sessions.

The icebreaker question was:
* Remind us what class you are working with?
* What are they learning right now?
* What is one thing the students are struggling with in your office hours?

We then covered the slides from Colleen Lewis's TA training (see week 1 for link.)
