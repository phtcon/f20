# Explanation / Observation Activity

* Look through a list of common questions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWwtF-r9RcklYFiB9tkY2j6nJ30fUV8TWMa3rFoWzjk)


We'll use Zoom breakout rooms with around 4 students:

* Break up into groups of 4



* One student will be the "tutor"
* One student will be the "student"
* Remaining students will be "observers", one of which is also the "timekeeper"


Observers will take notes on how the tutor worked with the student for
various topics.

* Each tutor will help answer the student questions in 2, 3, or 5 minute timeboxes
  (Timekeeper would keep track of the time taken.)
  
* After a tutor finishes the explanation, students will switch roles such that everyone will have an opportunity to be a tutor.
   * For each student observed, please submit comments on the google form: [https://forms.gle/F12LTd5YTQ9wwykNA](https://forms.gle/F12LTd5YTQ9wwykNA)

After each student has had a chance to take a turn tutoring, and/or at 1:20pm (with 25 minutes left in class), return to the main Zoom room for a whole group discussion.
