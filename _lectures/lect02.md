## Tips

**Dont's:**

* Don't take control of the students keyboard (without asking)
  - Doesn't apply as much in time of Covid (over Zoom), but even so.
* Don't give away the answer (unless they are really stuck, very trivial, very complicated, or student is extremely frustrated)
* Don't be condescending
* Don't be afraid to say I don't know but let's find out.
* Don't undermine the course, the lab, the instructor, your peers
* Don't use terms that students don't know
  - Or if you do, "remind them" what the term means.  Examples:

    "It looks like you may have a memory leak.  As a reminder,
     a memory leak is when ... "


**Do's:**

* Keep your cool even if the student is anxious or beligerent
* Keep the interaction and interesting
* Refer to the lab write up and syllabus where appropriate 
* Reflect on your tutoring/TA sessions
* If you don't know how to handle a situation, inform the TA or instructor.
