In this assignment we ask submit a recent photo and bio to share with our students. The idea is to help them get to know you better. 

1. (20 pts) Join the course slack at <https://ucsb-cs-open-lab.slack.com>

2. (20 pts) Join the course GitHub org via the GitHub linker
    at <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com>.   You need your ucsb email
    to be connected to your GitHub account.  Once you join the ucsb-cs190j-f20 course,
    then *accept the invitation* to the course.

3. (30 pts) Now upload your photo as a jpeg file to this [Mentor photos GitHub folder](https://github.com/ucsb-cs190j-f20/f20-mentor-bios-and-photos/tree/main/photos) 

    Use the naming convention described in the `README.md` of that folder.

4. (30 pts) Write your bio and a welcome message (300 to 400 words).  Use the format
    described in this folder:

    [Mentor bios GitHub folder](https://github.com/ucsb-cs190j-f20/f20-mentor-bios-and-photos/tree/main/bios)
